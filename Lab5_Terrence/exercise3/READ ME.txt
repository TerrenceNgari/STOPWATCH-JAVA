- How to Use
	Run the StoneGame class to start the game.

	Choose whether the human player or the computer player goes first.
	Follow the prompts to take turns removing stones from the pile.

- Adapting to Changes
	New Player Strategy: To introduce a new player with a different strategy, create a new subclass of Player and implement the pickStones method with the new strategy. The StoneGame class can then create an instance of the new player class and use it in the game.

	Multiple Piles of Stones: To introduce multiple piles of stones, modify the GameBoard class to manage multiple piles. Each player would then select a pile to remove stones from on their turn.

	Two Computers Playing: To have the game played between two computer players, modify the StoneGame class to create two instances of ComputerPlayer instead of a HumanPlayer and a ComputerPlayer.
